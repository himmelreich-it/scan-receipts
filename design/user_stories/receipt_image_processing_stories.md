# User Stories: Receipt Image Processing

**Feature**: Receipt Image Processing (RECEIPT_IMG_E5F6)  
**Description**: Processes receipt images and PDF files from the input folder, supporting PDF, JPG, and PNG formats. Handles sequential processing of all files in the input directory and manages file reading operations for AI analysis.

## User Story 1: Input Folder Scanning and File Filtering
**Code**: INPUT_SCAN_FILTER_A1B2  
**Functional Description**: Scans the input folder for files and filters them based on configurable file extensions, skipping unsupported file types without alerting the user.  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When input/ folder exists, return list of all files in the folder
- When file extension matches configured list (case-insensitive), include file in results
- When file extension does not match configured list, exclude file from results with no console output
- When input/ folder does not exist, create the folder and return empty list
- When input/ folder exists but is empty, return empty list
- When file has extension .PDF, .jpg, .JPEG, .png (any case), treat as supported format
- When configuration specifies extensions ['.pdf', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'], filter accordingly

**Technical Notes**: 
- Use configurable file extension list (default: ['.pdf', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'])
- Implement configuration mechanism for file extensions
- Use os.path or pathlib for file operations
- Handle both uppercase and lowercase extensions

**Dependencies**: None  
**Data Requirements**: 
- Configuration for supported file extensions
- File path list for valid files

**Error Scenarios**: 
- When input/ folder is missing, create folder and log "Created input folder" to console
- When permission denied accessing input/ folder, log "Permission denied: cannot access input folder" and exit with code 1
- When input/ folder is empty, log "No files found in input folder" and return empty list

## User Story 2: File Content Reading and Processing
**Code**: FILE_READ_PROCESS_C3D4  
**Functional Description**: Reads file content in the format required by the Claude Python library and handles corrupted or unreadable files with proper error handling.  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When reading supported file types, return file content in base64 format for Claude API
- When processing PDF file, read entire document content as single unit
- When processing JPG/PNG file, read complete image data
- When file cannot be read due to corruption, return error indicator with message "Failed to read file: [filename]"
- When file read operation succeeds, include original filename and file path in returned data
- When file size exceeds system memory, attempt streaming read or return memory error with specific message

**Technical Notes**: 
- Use Anthropic Python library's required file format (likely base64 or binary)
- Implement robust file reading with try-catch error handling
- For PDFs, read entire document content
- For images, read in format compatible with Claude API

**Dependencies**: User Story 1 (INPUT_SCAN_FILTER_A1B2)  
**Data Requirements**: 
- File content in Claude API format
- Error indicators for corrupted files
- Original filename preservation

**Error Scenarios**: 
- When file is corrupted, log "File corrupted: [filename]" and mark for error CSV entry
- When file has supported extension but unsupported internal format, log "Invalid file format: [filename]" and mark for error CSV entry
- When file access is denied, log "Permission denied: [filename]" and mark for error CSV entry
- When file causes memory error, log "File too large: [filename]" and mark for error CSV entry

## User Story 3: Sequential Processing Workflow Management
**Code**: SEQ_PROCESS_WORKFLOW_E5F6  
**Functional Description**: Coordinates the sequential processing of all filtered files and provides file data to downstream components in the processing pipeline.  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When processing file list, iterate through files one at a time in list order
- When processing each file, provide file content, original filename, and timestamp to downstream components
- When file processing completes successfully, mark file as "processed" in tracking
- When file processing fails, mark file as "error" in tracking and continue with next file
- When user interrupts processing (Ctrl+C), log "Processing interrupted by user" and exit cleanly
- When system error occurs, log specific error message and attempt to continue with next file

**Technical Notes**: 
- Implement sequential processing loop
- Provide interface for downstream components (AI extraction, file organization)
- Include file metadata (original name, path, processing timestamp)
- Support processing resumption if needed

**Dependencies**: User Story 2 (FILE_READ_PROCESS_C3D4)  
**Data Requirements**: 
- File processing queue
- File metadata (name, path, timestamp)
- Processing status tracking
- Interface for downstream component communication

**Error Scenarios**: 
- When user presses Ctrl+C, log "Processing stopped by user" and exit with code 0
- When downstream component returns error, log "Processing failed for [filename]: [error]" and continue
- When file is deleted/moved during processing, log "File no longer accessible: [filename]" and continue
- When processing queue becomes corrupted, log "Queue error: restarting processing" and rebuild queue

## Implementation Notes
- This feature serves as the foundation for AI Data Extraction
- File reading format must be compatible with Anthropic Claude API
- Error handling should integrate with CSV Data Output for error recording
- Sequential processing coordinates with File Organization System for moving processed files

## Dependencies
- None (foundational feature)

## Related Features
- AI Data Extraction (AI_EXTRACT_G7H8) - consumes file content
- File Organization System (FILE_ORG_K1L2) - handles processed file movement
- Error Handling (ERROR_HANDLE_O5P6) - processes file reading errors
