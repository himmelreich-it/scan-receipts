# User Stories: Receipt Processing Engine (RECEIPT_PROCESS_A8F5)

## Feature Overview
Core automated receipt processing system that handles file intake, AI-powered data extraction using Anthropic's Claude API, and structured data output. Provides the central functionality for converting receipt images into structured business data.

## User Stories

### Story Title: Core Receipt Analysis and Data Extraction
**Code**: RECEIPT_ANALYSIS_A1B2  
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED  
**Functional Description**: Complete AI-powered analysis of receipt files using Claude API to extract structured financial data including amounts, taxes, descriptions, currencies, dates, and confidence scores  
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- When valid receipt file (PDF, JPG, PNG) is processed, Claude Sonnet 4 API extracts amount, tax, tax_percentage, description, currency, date, and confidence fields
- When multiple dates exist on receipt, purchase date takes priority over printed date
- When receipt processing completes, structured JSON response contains all required fields with confidence score 0-100
- When API response is received, system parses JSON and validates all required fields are present
- When processing succeeds, console displays progress message with filename and confidence score
- When currency detection occurs, system assumes single currency per receipt
- When confidence score is low, system continues processing without additional validation
**Technical Notes**: Use Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) with thinking enabled, handle API rate limiting, implement proper JSON schema validation  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Data Requirements**: Extracts structured data: amount (float), tax (float), tax_percentage (float), description (string), currency (string), date (string), confidence (integer 0-100), generates file hash for duplicate detection  
**Error Scenarios**: API failures, malformed JSON responses, missing required fields, network timeouts, rate limit exceeded  

### Story Title: File Format Validation and Error Handling
**Code**: FILE_VALIDATION_C3D4  
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED  
**Functional Description**: Validates input file formats and handles various error scenarios including unreadable files, API failures, and corrupted data while ensuring processing continuity  
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- When file format is PDF, JPG, or PNG, system proceeds with processing
- When file format is unsupported, system logs "Unsupported file format: [filename]" to console and continues with next file
- When file is corrupted or unreadable, system creates CSV entry with confidence 0, description "ERROR", and logs error to console
- When Claude API fails, system creates CSV entry with confidence 0, description "ERROR", and logs "API failure for [filename]: [error message]" to console
- When JSON parsing fails, system creates CSV entry with confidence 0, description "ERROR", and logs parsing error to console
- When any file processing error occurs, system continues processing remaining files
- When file cannot be read, system logs specific error message and continues processing
**Technical Notes**: Implement file type detection, graceful error handling, comprehensive logging, ensure processing continuity after errors  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Data Requirements**: Creates error entries in structured format with confidence 0 and ERROR description for failed processing  
**Error Scenarios**: Corrupted files, unsupported formats, permission errors, disk space issues, API service unavailable  

### Story Title: Duplicate Detection and Management
**Code**: DUPLICATE_DETECTION_E5F6  
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED  
**Functional Description**: Prevents reprocessing of duplicate files using file hash comparison and provides clear user feedback about skipped duplicates  
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- When file is processed, system generates file hash for duplicate detection
- When file hash matches existing hash in processing session, system skips file and logs "Duplicate file skipped: [filename] (matches [original_filename])" to console
- When duplicate is detected, system does not send file to API or create CSV entry
- When duplicate detection occurs, system continues processing next file without interruption
- When file hash is generated, it is stored with extracted data for future duplicate comparison
- When processing session starts fresh, duplicate detection works within that session scope
**Technical Notes**: Implement file hashing algorithm (SHA-256 recommended), efficient hash comparison, clear duplicate logging  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Data Requirements**: Generates and stores file hash for each processed receipt, maintains hash comparison during processing session  
**Error Scenarios**: Hash generation failures, hash comparison errors, logging failures  

## Implementation Notes
- Use Claude Sonnet 4 API (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) with thinking enabled
- Implement structured JSON schema validation for API responses
- Ensure all error scenarios create entries with confidence 0 and description "ERROR"
- Console logging should provide clear progress updates and error information
- File hash generation required for duplicate detection functionality
- Processing should continue after individual file errors
- Single currency assumption per receipt simplifies extraction logic

## Dependencies
None - This is a foundational feature with no dependencies on other features.
