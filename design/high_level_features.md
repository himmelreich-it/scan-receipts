### DDD Analysis Notes
Features were identified using Domain-Driven Design principles:
- **Receipt Document Processing** represents the core entity lifecycle management
- **Financial Data Extraction** encapsulates external AI service integration as a domain service
- **Expense Record Management** handles the main business aggregate (expense records)
- **File System Organization** identified as supporting subdomain (not core business logic)
- **Processing Error Handling** designed as domain service spanning multiple aggregates
- **Processing Workflow Orchestration** serves as application service coordinating bounded contexts
- **Data Quality Assessment** represents domain service for business rule evaluation
- **Processing Progress Monitoring** provides application-level operational visibility

Each feature maintains clear boundaries, uses ubiquitous language from the business domain, and respects aggregate design principles.
