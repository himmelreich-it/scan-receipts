**Implementation Scope**:
- File format detection and validation (PDF, JPG, PNG)
- Integration with Anthropic Claude API for data extraction
- Structured JSON response parsing
- Error handling for unreadable files and API failures
- Progress tracking and console output
- Duplicate detection using file hashing

**Dependencies**: None
**User Stories**: user_stories/user_stories_receipt_processing_engine.md

## Feature: File Management System
**Code**: FILE_MGMT_B7C4  
**Status**: NEW
**Description**: Complete file organization system that manages input receipt files, processed file archiving, and folder structure maintenance. Handles the full lifecycle of receipt files from input to processed storage with proper naming conventions.
**Implementation Scope**:
- Input folder scanning and file discovery
- Processed file copying to done folder with timestamped naming
- Folder structure creation and maintenance
- File cleanup and initialization (clearing done folder, removing existing CSV)
- File hash generation for duplicate detection

**Dependencies**: None

## Feature: CSV Data Export
**Code**: CSV_EXPORT_C9D3  
**Status**: NEW
**Description**: Structured data output system that converts extracted receipt information into CSV format for business expense tracking. Manages data formatting, field mapping, and file generation with proper headers and incremental ID assignment.
**Implementation Scope**:
- CSV file creation and header management
- Data field mapping (Amount, Tax, Description, Currency, Date, Confidence, etc.)
- Incremental ID generation for each processed receipt
- Date formatting standardization (dd-MM-YYYY)
- Fresh CSV generation on each run
- Error entry handling with confidence 0 markers

**Dependencies**: Hard - Receipt Processing Engine [RECEIPT_PROCESS_A8F5]

## Feature: Command Line Interface
**Code**: CLI_INTERFACE_D5E7  
**Status**: NEW
**Description**: Terminal-based user interface that provides execution control, progress monitoring, and results display. Designed for tech-savvy users who need visibility into processing status and error reporting.
**Implementation Scope**:
- Main entry point script (main.py) execution via uv
- Real-time progress display during processing
- Error logging and console output
- Processing summary reporting (total files, errors encountered)
- Fresh processing mode initialization

**Dependencies**: Soft - Receipt Processing Engine [RECEIPT_PROCESS_A8F5], File Management System [FILE_MGMT_B7C4], CSV Data Export [CSV_EXPORT_C9D3]

## Feature: Error Handling and Recovery
**Code**: ERROR_HANDLING_E6F8  
**Status**: NEW
**Description**: Comprehensive error management system that handles various failure scenarios while ensuring processing continuity. Provides graceful degradation and clear error reporting for unreadable files, API failures, and system issues.
**Implementation Scope**:
- Unreadable file error handling with ERROR marker in CSV
- API failure recovery and error logging
- Corrupted file processing with ERROR prefix in done folder
- CSV corruption detection and execution halt
- Continued processing after individual file errors
- Console error reporting and logging

**Dependencies**: Hard - Receipt Processing Engine [RECEIPT_PROCESS_A8F5], File Management System [FILE_MGMT_B7C4], CSV Data Export [CSV_EXPORT_C9D3]
