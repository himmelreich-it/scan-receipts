# AI Code Agent Instructions - User Story Implementation

## System Overview
Implement user stories from pre-analyzed documentation. All planning, dependency analysis, and design decisions have been completed upstream. Your job: code, test, validate.

## Input Documents (Pre-Analyzed)
- **User Story Documentation**: Ready-to-implement stories with dependencies resolved
- **Implementation Specification**: Architectural design with interface definitions and design patterns
- **Python Code Guidelines**: Coding standards to follow

## Core Workflow

### 1. Select User Story
- Find first user story WITHOUT **IMPLEMENTED** marker
- Choose story with fewest dependencies among unimplemented
- **HALT** if all stories are implemented or story is incomplete

### 2. Implement Code
- Use implementation specification as architectural guidance - interface definitions, design patterns, algorithms
- Implement actual working code based on the specification's contracts and user story acceptance criteria
- If specification is ambiguous or incomplete, **HALT** with specific questions
- Follow Python code guidelines for all code decisions
- Create files in specified package structure only
- Implement MVP only - no extras beyond acceptance criteria
- **HALT** after 3 failed correction attempts

### 3. Handle Missing Dependencies
When encountering calls to unimplemented functionality:

#### Create Dummy Implementation
```python
def missing_feature_placeholder(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    PLACEHOLDER: This feature is not yet implemented.
    
    Expected implementation based on user story analysis:
    - User Story Reference: [US-XXX]
    - Expected functionality: [describe what this should do]
    - Expected parameters: [list expected args/kwargs]
    - Expected return: [describe expected return value/type]
    
    TODO: Implement this when [referenced user story] is completed
    """
    import logging
    logging.warning(f"Called unimplemented feature: {missing_feature_placeholder.__name__}")
    
    # Return appropriate dummy data based on expected return type
    # For collections: return empty list/dict
    # For objects: return None or minimal mock object
    # For primitives: return sensible default
    return None  # Adjust based on expected return type
```

#### Logging Requirements
```python
import logging

# Log every call to unimplemented functionality
logging.warning(
    f"UNIMPLEMENTED_DEPENDENCY: {function_name} "
    f"from story {current_story_id} "
    f"requires {dependency_story_id}"
)
```

### 4. Generate Tests
- Test ONLY acceptance criteria explicitly stated in user story
- DO NOT invent additional test cases or edge cases
- Unit tests: mock external dependencies using dummy implementations
- Integration tests: test only class interactions specified in story
- Use pytest framework
- Test structure:
  ```python
  def test_acceptance_criteria_1():
      """Test: [copy exact acceptance criteria text]"""
      # Implementation
  ```

### 5. Validate
- Run new tests first
- Run all existing tests
- **HALT** if any tests fail after corrections
- Verify acceptance criteria are met exactly as written

### 6. Update Documentation
- Add `**Status:**: IMPLEMENTED  ` below user story name
- Add implementation results at bottom of user story:
  ```
  ## Implementation Results
  - Files created: [list with paths]
  - Dependencies mocked: [list with references to user stories]
  - Tests created: [count and types]
  - All acceptance criteria: PASS/FAIL
  ```

## Strict Boundaries

### DO NOT:
- Implement features not explicitly in acceptance criteria
- Add error handling not specified in user story
- Create additional classes/methods beyond specification
- Optimize code beyond basic functionality
- Add logging/monitoring beyond dummy dependency tracking
- Implement security features unless explicitly required
- Add input validation beyond what's specified

### ONLY DO:
- Implement exact acceptance criteria
- Follow provided Python code guidelines
- Create specified file structure
- Generate tests for stated acceptance criteria
- Handle missing dependencies with logged placeholders

## Halt Conditions
- **Missing/Ambiguous Specification**: Cannot determine exact requirements → HALT
- **Circular Dependencies**: Detected → HALT
- **Test Failures**: After 3 correction attempts → HALT
- **Incomplete Stories**: Missing critical information → HALT
- **File System Errors**: Cannot create required files → HALT

## Error Handling Protocol
1. **First Attempt**: Fix obvious syntax/import errors
2. **Second Attempt**: Review against acceptance criteria
3. **Third Attempt**: Simplify implementation to bare minimum
4. **After Third Failure**: HALT with diagnostic information

## Dummy Implementation Guidelines

### For Missing Classes:
```python
class PlaceholderClass:
    """
    PLACEHOLDER: Class not yet implemented
    User Story: [US-XXX]
    Expected interface: [list methods/properties from analysis]
    """
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        logging.warning(f"Using placeholder for {self.__class__.__name__}")
        
    def expected_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
        logging.warning(f"Called unimplemented method: {self.expected_method.__name__}")
        return None
```

### For Missing Functions:
```python
def placeholder_function(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    PLACEHOLDER: Function not yet implemented
    User Story: [US-XXX]
    Expected behavior: [describe from analysis]
    """
    logging.warning(f"Called unimplemented function: {placeholder_function.__name__}")
    return None  # or appropriate default
```

### For Missing Constants/Config:
```python
# PLACEHOLDER: Configuration not yet implemented
# User Story: [US-XXX]
# Expected values: [describe from analysis]
PLACEHOLDER_CONFIG = {
    'default_value': None,
    'placeholder_note': 'Implement when US-XXX is completed'
}
```

## Success Criteria
1. All acceptance criteria implemented exactly as written
2. All tests pass (new and existing)
3. Code follows Python guidelines exactly
4. User story marked **IMPLEMENTED**
5. No breaking changes to existing code
6. All missing dependencies properly logged with references

## Output Requirements
- **Implementation Summary**: What was built (only features in acceptance criteria)
- **Test Results**: Pass/fail status with test names
- **File Locations**: Exact paths where code was created
- **Placeholder Dependencies**: List of dummy implementations with user story references
- **Any Issues**: Problems and resolutions
- **Acceptance Criteria Status**: PASS/FAIL for each criterion
