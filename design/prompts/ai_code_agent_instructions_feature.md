# AI Code Agent Instructions - Complete Feature Implementation

## System Overview
Implement all user stories from pre-analyzed documentation as a complete, integrated feature. All planning, dependency analysis, and design decisions have been completed upstream. Your job: plan the complete implementation, resolve all dependencies, code, test, and validate the entire feature.

## Input Documents (Pre-Analyzed)
- **User Story Documentation**: Complete set of stories defining the feature
- **Implementation Specification**: Architectural design with interface definitions, design patterns, and integration points
- **Python Code Guidelines**: Coding standards to follow

## Core Workflow

### 1. Feature Analysis Phase
- **Inventory All Stories**: Identify all user stories in the documentation
- **Status Assessment**: Identify stories marked `Status: OUTDATED` that need updating alongside new implementations
- **Dependency Mapping**: Create complete dependency graph across all stories
- **Implementation Order**: Determine optimal implementation sequence using topological sort
- **Integration Points**: Identify where stories interact and data flows between them
- **Feature Boundaries**: Define the complete scope of the feature being built

### 2. Implementation Planning
- **Architecture Review**: Use implementation specification to understand system design and ensure all stories form a cohesive system
- **Change Impact Assessment**: For outdated stories, analyze what changed in requirements and which existing code needs modification
- **Interface Implementation**: Implement the interface contracts defined in the specification
- **Design Pattern Application**: Apply the design patterns specified in the architectural guidance
- **Data Flow Implementation**: Implement data flow based on specification's integration points
- **Testing Strategy**: Plan unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for complete feature

### 3. Dependency Resolution
Instead of creating dummy implementations:
- **Implement Dependencies First**: Follow dependency order from analysis
- **Build Foundation Classes**: Implement core classes that other stories depend on
- **Validate Interfaces**: Ensure all dependencies are properly satisfied
- **Integration Testing**: Test each component as it's integrated

### 4. Complete Feature Implementation

#### Implementation Strategy:
1. **Foundation Layer**: Implement core classes and utilities (stories with no dependencies)
2. **Service Layer**: Implement business logic and services (stories depending on foundation)
3. **Interface Layer**: Implement user-facing interfaces (stories depending on services)
4. **Integration Layer**: Implement cross-cutting concerns and workflow orchestration

#### For Each Implementation Layer:
- Implement all stories in that layer simultaneously
- Ensure inter-story communication works properly
- Test layer functionality before moving to next layer
- Validate that layer satisfies all dependent stories

#### Update Handling Process:
For stories marked `Status: OUTDATED`:
1. **Analyze Changes**: Compare current requirements with existing implementation
2. **Update Implementation**: Modify existing code to meet new requirements  
3. **Update Tests**: Ensure tests cover new requirements
4. **Validate Dependencies**: Ensure dependent stories still work correctly

### 5. Comprehensive Testing

#### Test Categories:
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components from each user story
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between user stories
3. **Feature Tests**: Test complete workflows spanning multiple stories
4. **BDD Tests**: Execute all feature scenarios end-to-end
5. **End-to-End Tests**: Test entire feature from user perspective
6. **Regression Tests**: Ensure updates to outdated stories don't break existing functionality

#### Test Structure:
```python
class TestFeatureComplete:
    """Test complete feature across all user stories"""
    
    def test_complete_workflow_story_1_to_n(self):
        """Test: Complete workflow from [first story] through [last story]"""
        # Implementation testing entire feature flow
    
    def test_user_story_acceptance_criteria(self):
        """Test: [copy exact acceptance criteria for each story]"""
        # Test each story's acceptance criteria in integrated context
```

### 6. Feature Validation
- **All User Stories**: Verify every story's acceptance criteria are met
- **BDD Scenarios**: All feature scenarios pass
- **Integration Points**: Validate all stories work together seamlessly
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure data flows correctly between stories
- **Error Handling**: Verify error conditions are handled across story boundaries
- **Performance**: Basic performance validation of complete feature

### 7. Documentation Update
Mark all user stories as **IMPLEMENTED** and add comprehensive implementation summary:

**Step 7a: Update User Story Status**
- Add `**Status**: IMPLEMENTED` to each user story that was successfully implemented
- Change `**Status**: OUTDATED` to `**Status**: IMPLEMENTED` for successfully updated stories
- Do NOT change any other content in the user story documentation
- Only add the status field to stories that have been fully implemented and tested
- Leave incomplete or failed stories without the status field

**Step 7b: Create Implementation Summary**
```
## Complete Feature Implementation Results
- **Feature Name**: [Name of complete feature]
- **Stories Implemented**: [List all story IDs]
- **Stories Updated**: [List story IDs that were updated from OUTDATED status]
- **Files Created**: [Complete file tree with all paths]
- **Files Modified**: [List of existing files that were updated]
- **Architecture**: [Brief description of how stories fit together]
- **Public APIs**: [List all public interfaces]
- **Integration Points**: [How stories communicate]
- **Test Coverage**: [Unit: X, Integration: Y, End-to-End: Z, **BDD: Z**]
- **BDD Scenarios**: [List all executed scenarios and status]
- **All Acceptance Criteria**: PASS/FAIL for each story
- **Feature Validation**: PASS/FAIL for complete feature
```

## BDD Implementation Guidelines

### Complete Feature BDD Strategy
- **Feature-Level Scenarios**: Implement all BDD scenarios for the complete feature
- **Cross-Story Workflows**: Create scenarios that span multiple user stories
- **Integration Scenarios**: Test how stories work together
- **End-to-End Scenarios**: Test complete user journeys across the feature

### Step Definition Creation
- Implement step definitions in `tests/bdd/steps/`
- Map each step to corresponding application functionality
- Use page object pattern for UI interactions where applicable
- Reuse step definitions across scenarios where possible
- Create shared step definitions for common feature workflows

### BDD Test Structure
```python
# tests/bdd/steps/feature_steps.py
from behave import given, when, then
from your_app.main import YourApp

@given('the complete feature is initialized')
def step_impl(context):
    context.app = YourApp()
    context.feature = context.app.get_feature()

@when('user completes workflow spanning multiple stories')
def step_impl(context):
    context.result = context.feature.complete_workflow()

@then('all user stories work together seamlessly')
def step_impl(context):
    assert context.result.all_stories_integrated == True
```

### BDD Validation Requirements
- All feature scenarios must pass
- Step definitions must call actual application code (no mocks in BDD tests)
- Use context object to share state between steps
- Clear assertion messages for failed scenarios
- Test complete feature workflows, not just individual stories

## Implementation Guidelines

### DO:
- **Implement Complete Feature**: Build all stories as integrated system
- **Handle Updates Gracefully**: Update outdated stories without breaking dependent code
- **Follow Dependency Order**: Implement foundation stories first
- **Validate Integration**: Test story interactions at each step
- **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure consistent interfaces across stories
- **Document Architecture**: Show how all pieces fit together
- **Test Comprehensively**: Unit, integration, BDD, and end-to-end testing

### DO NOT:
- **Implement Stories in Isolation**: Stories must work together
- **Skip Integration Testing**: Each integration point must be validated
- **Skip Regression Testing**: Updates must not break existing functionality
- **Create Dummy Implementations**: All dependencies must be real
- **Ignore Story Interactions**: Stories often depend on each other
- **Optimize Prematurely**: Focus on complete, working feature first

## Dependency Resolution Strategy

### Instead of Dummy Implementations:
1. **Identify True Dependencies**: Map actual dependencies between stories
2. **Implement Bottom-Up**: Start with stories that have no dependencies
3. **Validate Each Layer**: Test each dependency layer before building on it
4. **Real Integration**: Use actual implementations, not placeholders

### For Missing External Dependencies:
```python
def external_dependency_adapter(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    ADAPTER: External dependency not available in current environment
    
    This represents a real external system that would be available in production:
    - External System: [name]
    - Expected Interface: [describe interface]
    - Current Behavior: [describe what this does in absence of real system]
    
    TODO: Connect to real external system in production environment
    """
    import logging
    logging.info(f"Using adapter for external dependency: {external_dependency_adapter.__name__}")
    
    # Return realistic test data that allows feature to work
    return realistic_test_data
```
