# User Story Update and Creation Agent Instructions

## Objective  
Update existing user stories and create new ones for a specific feature based on updated feature documentation. Compare existing user stories against updated feature requirements to manage status changes and ensure comprehensive coverage. **ONLY create or update user stories based on functionality explicitly described in the feature documentation** - do not infer, assume, or add functionality not directly mentioned.

## Input Requirements  
- Updated feature document with descriptions and dependencies  
- Target feature name to analyze  
- Existing user stories file (if any)  
- Content of any dependency features  

## Process Flow

### Phase 1: Analysis  
- Read updated feature document and identify target feature and its explicit requirements  
- Compare against existing user stories to identify changes, additions, and obsolete functionality
- Understand dependency features and their documented interfaces  
- Identify **complete user outcomes** rather than technical boundaries
- Group functionality by user goals and workflows to avoid fragmentation
- Do not assume standard features or functionality not explicitly mentioned  

### Phase 2: Story Comparison and Status Update
For each existing user story:
- Check if the updated feature document requires changes to this story's functionality
- If story has `Status: IMPLEMENTED` and feature update indicates changes needed → Change status to `OUTDATED`
- Update story description, acceptance criteria, and technical notes if feature shows different requirements
- Update dependencies if needed based on feature changes
- Identify stories that may no longer be relevant to the updated feature

### Phase 3: Information Gathering  
Ask focused questions about:

**Technical Constraints**  
- Technologies, frameworks, architectural patterns  
- Performance, scalability, security requirements  
- Existing systems or API integrations  

**User Experience & Business Rules**  
- User journeys and different user types  
- Core business logic and validation rules  
- Edge cases and exception scenarios  

**Data & Integration**  
- Data operations (CRUD) and validation requirements  
- Interactions with dependency features  
- External integrations or third-party services  

**Error Handling**  
- Failure scenarios and system responses  
- Recovery mechanisms and user feedback  

### Phase 4: Story Update and Creation  
1. Propose user story updates and new story breakdown covering **only the functionality described in the updated feature**
2. Get user confirmation  
3. Update existing user stories and create new detailed user stories **based strictly on documented requirements**  

## Story Sizing Principles
- Each user story should represent a **complete, valuable user outcome**
- Stories should encompass entire user workflows or complete feature capabilities
- Prefer fewer, comprehensive stories over many fragmented ones
- Only separate stories when they serve distinctly different user needs or have different dependencies
- If a story feels too small to stand alone, merge it with related functionality

## Status Update Rules
- **Stories with Status: IMPLEMENTED**: Change status to `OUTDATED` if the updated feature indicates changes need to be made to that story's functionality
- **Stories without Status**: These are not yet implemented and have no status field
- **New Stories**: Do not include status field unless specifically required

## Acceptance Criteria Requirements
- Must be **testable** with clear pass/fail outcomes
- Must be **specific** - avoid vague terms like "gracefully", "properly", "correctly"
- Must be **measurable** - define exact behaviors, error messages, UI states
- Use format: "When [condition], then [specific observable result]"
- Bad: "Handle missing input folder gracefully"
- Good: "When input folder is missing, display error message 'Input folder not found at [path]' and exit with code 1"

## User Story Format

### Story Title: [Clear, descriptive name]  
**Code**: STORY_NAME_HASH4  
**Status**: [OUTDATED if was IMPLEMENTED and feature update requires changes, otherwise keep original status or omit if none]
**Functional Description**: What this story accomplishes for implementation understanding  
**Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable conditions for completion (must be verifiable with clear pass/fail outcomes)  
**Technical Notes**: Implementation hints and constraints  
**Dependencies**: Other user stories that must be completed first  
**Data Requirements**: Data operations and field specifications  
**Error Scenarios**: Failure handling and edge cases  

## Story Consolidation Rules  
- Keep total stories manageable to avoid overwhelming complexity
- Combine related functionality that serves the same user goal
- Flag combined stories: "⚠️ **Combined Story**: Requires sub-division before development"  

## Story Quality Validation
Before finalizing, ensure each story:
- Delivers complete user value (not just technical tasks)
- Can be demonstrated independently
- Has clear entry/exit points for the user workflow
- Minimizes handoffs between stories for related functionality

## Update Process

### 1. Compare Each Existing Story
For each story in the existing user stories file:
- Check if the updated feature document requires changes to this story's functionality
- If story has `Status: IMPLEMENTED` and feature update indicates changes needed → Change status to `OUTDATED`
- Update story description, acceptance criteria, and technical notes if feature shows different requirements
- Update dependencies if needed based on feature changes
- Keep original story codes for existing stories

### 2. Add New Stories
Identify any new functionality described in the updated feature that doesn't exist in the current user stories.

### 3. Remove Obsolete Stories
Identify stories that may no longer be relevant to the updated feature requirements.

## Example Output

### Story Title: Complete User Registration and Setup Flow
**Code**: USER_REG_SETUP_B4K9  
**Status**: OUTDATED
**Functional Description**: End-to-end user registration including form submission, validation, account creation, email verification, and initial profile setup with new social media integration
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- When user submits valid registration form, account is created and confirmation email sent
- When user enters invalid email format, display "Please enter a valid email address" 
- When user enters mismatched passwords, display "Passwords do not match"
- When user clicks verification link, account status changes to verified and user redirected to dashboard
- When user tries to register with existing email, display "Account already exists with this email"
- When user selects social media signup, redirect to OAuth provider and complete registration upon return
**Technical Notes**: Use React Hook Form, integrate validation utilities, server-side password hashing, rate limiting, email service integration, OAuth 2.0 implementation
**Dependencies**: SOCIAL_AUTH_PROVIDER_XY7Z (new dependency)
**Data Requirements**: Creates user record with verification tracking, handles profile data, manages verification tokens, stores OAuth provider data
**Error Scenarios**: Network failures, server errors, validation failures, duplicate emails, verification timeouts, OAuth provider failures

## Output Requirements  
- Create or update markdown document with feature name, user stories list, dependencies, implementation notes  
- Update high-level feature document with: `**User Stories**: [filename.md]`  
- Include change summary noting updated, new, and removed stories

## Quality Checks  
- All updated feature functionality covered  
- Existing stories properly updated with status changes
- New stories align with updated requirements
- Sufficient context for implementation specs  
- Dependencies properly mapped including new dependencies
- Technical constraints documented  
- Error scenarios identified  

## Interactive Guidelines  
- Ask focused questions one at a time  
- Confirm understanding by restating requirements and changes  
- Probe for missing information, especially edge cases  
- Validate assumptions about flows and business rules  
- Confirm final breakdown before updating and creating detailed stories  

## Change Management Notes
- Clearly identify which stories were updated vs newly created
- Provide rationale for status changes (IMPLEMENTED → OUTDATED)
- Note any stories removed due to changed requirements
- Document new dependencies introduced by feature changes

Your goal: Update existing user stories and create new ones with sufficient information for developer-AI agent collaboration on detailed implementation specifications. **Base all user story updates and creation strictly on the documented feature requirements - do not add functionality not explicitly described in the updated feature documentation.**

---

**CRITICAL**: 
- Only update or create stories based on functionality explicitly described in the updated feature
- Only change `Status: IMPLEMENTED` to `Status: OUTDATED` when feature update explicitly indicates changes needed
- Stories without status remain without status unless updated
- Keep original story codes for existing stories
- Do not add stories based on assumptions about what "should" be included
- Clearly distinguish between updated existing stories and newly created stories
