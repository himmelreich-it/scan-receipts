# AI Code Agent Instructions: High-Level Architecture Design with LikeC4

## Core Objective
Transform project requirements into LikeC4 architecture diagrams at the component level for high-level design. This is NOT user story implementation design - that occurs in downstream phases.

## Input Context
The agent will receive:
- **Project requirements** (PRD, feature documents, descriptions)
- **User story implementation design instructions** (for downstream phase understanding)
- **Agent coding instruction set** (for implementation phase context)
- **Coding guidelines** (platform-specific constraints)
- **Existing LikeC4 files** (for updates requiring backward compatibility)

## Core Rules

### 1. Requirement Adherence
- **Only design components explicitly mentioned** in requirements
- **Do not invent functionality** not specified in documents
- **Stay within documented scope** - no feature expansion
- **Map components to business requirements** directly

### 2. High-Level Design Focus
- **Component-level architecture** only
- **System boundaries and interactions**
- **Technology stack integration points**
- **External system dependencies**
- **NOT detailed implementation design**

### 3. Platform Considerations
- **Use coding guidelines** to determine platform constraints
- **If platform unspecified**: Create platform-agnostic design
- **Tag components** with relevant technology when known
- **Consider deployment and runtime constraints**

## Interactive Validation Protocol

### Requirements Clarification
When requirements are unclear:
```
"Requirement [X] mentions [component]. I need clarification:
1. What are the specific responsibilities of [component]?
2. How does [component] interact with [other component]?
3. Are there performance or scalability requirements for [component]?"
```

### Technology Stack Validation
When platform/technology is unclear:
```
"Based on coding guidelines, I see [technology stack]. For [component]:
1. Should this use [specific framework/platform]?
2. Are there existing systems this must integrate with?
3. What are the deployment constraints?"
```

### Backward Compatibility Check
When updating existing architecture:
```
"I see existing component [X] in current architecture. The new requirements suggest [change]:
1. Can [X] be extended or must it be replaced?
2. What are the migration constraints?
3. Which dependent systems would be affected?"
```

## Update Handling

### Existing Architecture Analysis
1. **Parse current LikeC4** for existing components and relationships
2. **Identify impact areas** from new requirements
3. **Flag breaking changes** that affect existing implementations
4. **Propose incremental updates** when possible

### Conflict Resolution
When new requirements conflict with existing architecture:
1. **Document the conflict** clearly
2. **Present options** (extend, replace, migrate)
3. **Ask for direction** on handling breaking changes
4. **Estimate impact** on existing systems

## LikeC4 Generation Rules

### Component Definition
- **Use requirement-based naming** (match document terminology)
- **Group by business domain** or functional area
- **Include technology tags** when specified in guidelines
- **Define clear boundaries** between components

### Relationship Mapping
- **Only include relationships** specified in requirements
- **Use descriptive labels** that match business language
- **Indicate synchronous/asynchronous** when specified
- **Show data flow direction** clearly

### Standard Structure
```
specification {
  element [elementType] {
    // Only components from requirements
  }
  
  relationship [source] -> [target] {
    // Only relationships from requirements
  }
}

views {
  view [viewName] {
    // High-level component view
  }
}
```

## Validation Checklist

## Error Handling

### Missing Requirements
```
"Cannot proceed without clarification on [specific requirement]. 
This affects [components] and their [relationships/responsibilities].
Please provide: [specific information needed]"
```

### Breaking Changes
```
"New requirements create breaking change: [description]
Current: [existing implementation]
Required: [new implementation]
Options: [extend/replace/migrate]
Recommendation: [option] because [reasoning]"
```

### Platform Conflicts
```
"Coding guidelines specify [platform] but requirements suggest [conflict].
This affects [components] in [specific way].
Need clarification on: [specific technical decisions]"
```

## Session Flow

1. **Analyze all input context** (requirements, guidelines, existing files)
2. **Identify components** explicitly mentioned in requirements
3. **Map relationships** from documented dependencies
4. **Validate against platform constraints**
5. **Check backward compatibility** if updating
6. **Ask clarifying questions** for unclear areas
7. **Generate LikeC4 architecture**
8. **Present for validation** and iterate

## Key Constraints

- **High-level design only** - no implementation details
- **Requirement-driven** - no feature invention
- **Platform-aware** - consider coding guidelines
- **Backward compatible** - preserve existing systems
- **Interactive** - ask questions, don't assume
- **Focused output** - LikeC4 code only unless requested otherwise
