# Receipt Document Processing - User Stories

## Feature Overview
**Feature Name**: Receipt Document Processing  
**Description**: Core bounded context for managing receipt documents through their lifecycle from input to processed state. Handles document validation, format support (PDF, JPG, PNG), and maintains document integrity throughout processing workflow.  
**Dependencies**: None

## User Stories

### Story 1: Document Discovery and Folder Management
**Functional Description**: The system must discover all receipt documents in the input folder and ensure proper folder structure exists for processing. This includes creating necessary folders if they don't exist and scanning for all supported file formats.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System creates `input/` folder if it doesn't exist
- System creates `done/` folder if it doesn't exist
- System scans `input/` folder for all PDF, JPG, and PNG files
- System processes files sequentially (no specific order requirement)
- System logs empty folder message if no files found
- System halts with error message if folders cannot be created due to permissions

**Technical Notes**: Use file system operations to check folder existence and create if needed. Handle permission errors gracefully by halting execution with clear error messages.

**Dependencies**: None

**Data Requirements**: Access to file system for folder creation and file discovery.

**Error Scenarios**: 
- Permission denied creating folders → Halt execution with console error
- Empty input folder → Log message and continue (no processing needed)

### Story 2: Sequential ID Generation
**Functional Description**: Generate unique sequential IDs for each processed receipt document, starting from 1 and continuing from the last processed receipt if a CSV file already exists.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- If receipts.csv doesn't exist, start ID sequence at 1
- If receipts.csv exists, read last ID and continue sequence from next number
- Generate unique sequential ID for each document processed
- Handle CSV corruption by halting execution with error message
- Ensure ID uniqueness across processing sessions

**Technical Notes**: Parse existing CSV to determine last used ID. Implement robust CSV reading with error handling for corrupted files.

**Dependencies**: None

**Data Requirements**: Read access to receipts.csv file if it exists.

**Error Scenarios**:
- CSV file corrupted/unreadable → Halt execution with console error
- Cannot determine last ID → Halt execution with console error

### Story 3: File Hash Calculation and Duplicate Detection
**Functional Description**: Calculate file hash for each document to enable duplicate detection and skip processing of duplicate files based on hash comparison with existing CSV records.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Calculate hash for each discovered file
- Compare hash against existing hashes in CSV file
- Skip duplicate files and log to console
- Handle hash calculation failures gracefully
- Store hash as `CREATIONFAILED-{guid}` if hash calculation fails

**Technical Notes**: Use SHA-256 or similar hashing algorithm. Generate GUID for failed hash scenarios. Implement hash comparison logic against CSV records.

**Dependencies**: Story 2 (Sequential ID Generation) - needs access to existing CSV

**Data Requirements**: File content for hash calculation, existing CSV hash column for comparison.

**Error Scenarios**:
- Hash calculation fails → Use `CREATIONFAILED-{guid}` format, log to console, continue processing
- Duplicate file detected → Skip processing, log to console

### Story 4: Document File Reading and Validation
**Functional Description**: Read receipt document files and perform basic validation to ensure they can be processed by downstream features. Handle various file reading errors appropriately.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Read PDF, JPG, and PNG files from input folder
- Skip files with unsupported extensions and log to console
- Handle file reading errors as per requirements document
- Validate files can be opened/read
- Trust file extensions for format validation

**Technical Notes**: Use appropriate libraries for reading different file formats. Implement error handling for corrupted files, permission issues, and unsupported formats.

**Dependencies**: Story 1 (Document Discovery) - needs discovered files

**Data Requirements**: File system access to read document files.

**Error Scenarios**:
- Unsupported file type → Skip file, log to console
- File reading error → Handle as per requirements document error handling strategy
- Corrupted file → Process as error, continue with remaining files

### Story 5: Document Metadata Collection
**Functional Description**: Collect essential metadata for each processed receipt document including original filename, processing timestamp, and file hash to support audit trail and file management.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Capture original filename for each document
- Generate processing timestamp in format %Y%m%d-%H%M%S%f
- Associate metadata with generated sequential ID
- Prepare metadata for downstream features
- Ensure metadata integrity throughout processing

**Technical Notes**: Use datetime library for timestamp generation. Store metadata in structured format for easy access by dependent features.

**Dependencies**: Story 2 (Sequential ID Generation), Story 3 (File Hash Calculation)

**Data Requirements**: File system metadata, generated ID, calculated hash, timestamp.

**Error Scenarios**: All metadata collection should be reliable; any failures should be logged but not halt processing.

### Story 6: Document Processing State Management
**Functional Description**: Manage the processing state of each document throughout the Receipt Document Processing workflow, ensuring clean transitions and proper state tracking.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Track document from discovered → processing → completed states
- Maintain processing state for each document
- Ensure atomic operations for state transitions
- Provide current state information to dependent features
- Handle state management errors gracefully

**Technical Notes**: Implement simple state tracking mechanism. No complex state persistence required since feature is transactional.

**Dependencies**: Story 1 (Document Discovery), Story 4 (Document File Reading)

**Data Requirements**: In-memory state tracking for each document being processed.

**Error Scenarios**: State management failures should not halt processing; log errors and continue.

### Story 7: Error Handling and Recovery
**Functional Description**: Implement comprehensive error handling strategy for all document processing scenarios, ensuring system continues processing remaining files after recoverable errors.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Handle file reading errors as per requirements document
- Log all errors to console with descriptive messages
- Continue processing remaining files after recoverable errors
- Halt execution for critical errors (folder creation, CSV corruption)
- Provide clear error messages for user troubleshooting

**Technical Notes**: Implement error categorization (recoverable vs. critical). Use structured logging for consistent error reporting.

**Dependencies**: All other stories - provides error handling for all operations

**Data Requirements**: Error logging capability, console output access.

**Error Scenarios**: This story defines how to handle all error scenarios from other stories.

### Story 8: Integration Interface for Dependent Features
**Functional Description**: Provide clean interfaces and data structures for dependent features (Financial Data Extraction, File System Organization) to access processed document information and content.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Expose processed document data to Financial Data Extraction feature
- Provide document metadata to File System Organization feature
- Ensure data format compatibility with dependent features
- Maintain data integrity during handoff to dependent features
- Support sequential processing workflow

**Technical Notes**: Define clear data contracts and interfaces. Ensure proper data serialization/deserialization. Design for loose coupling between features.

**Dependencies**: Story 5 (Document Metadata Collection), Story 6 (Document Processing State Management)

**Data Requirements**: Processed document data, metadata, and state information formatted for dependent features.

**Error Scenarios**: Interface failures should be logged but not halt processing; dependent features should handle missing data gracefully.

## Implementation Notes

### DDD Considerations
- This feature represents the core entity lifecycle management for receipt documents
- Focus on domain concepts like document identity, processing states, and business rules
- Maintain clear boundaries with other bounded contexts
- Use ubiquitous language: "receipt document", "processing", "duplicate detection"

### Story Dependencies
```
Story 1 (Document Discovery) → Story 4 (Document File Reading)
Story 2 (Sequential ID Generation) → Story 3 (File Hash Calculation)
Story 3 (File Hash Calculation) → Story 5 (Document Metadata Collection)
Story 4 (Document File Reading) → Story 6 (Document Processing State Management)
Story 5 (Document Metadata Collection) → Story 8 (Integration Interface)
Story 6 (Document Processing State Management) → Story 8 (Integration Interface)
Story 7 (Error Handling) → All stories (cross-cutting concern)
```

### Integration Points
- **Financial Data Extraction**: Requires document content and metadata
- **File System Organization**: Requires processed document information and metadata
- **Processing Progress Monitoring**: Will display processing status (separate feature)
- **Processing Error Handling**: Will handle error scenarios (separate feature)

### Technical Architecture Notes
- Feature should be purely transactional (no state persistence between runs)
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Implement repository pattern for CSV access
- Focus on single responsibility for each story
- Ensure proper separation of concerns between document processing and file management
